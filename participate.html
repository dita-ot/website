title: "How to participate in the DITA Open Toolkit"
---
<p>Any individual or any organization can contribute to the project; contributions must adhere to the existing toolkit license(s) and should fit in with the general goals of the
  project. All major contributors will get appropriate recognition in release announcements and on the project home page.</p>
<p>Contributors can submit new features, patches, and bug fixes using existing GitHub facilities (this is done by creating a "pull request" within GitHub). The Committer(s) who owns
  the relevant components will first do due diligence to check code originality and licensing according to the <a href="contribution_policy.html">DITA Open Toolkit Contribution Policy</a>. After due diligence, the Committer(s) will use his/her own judgment on whether to accept the code into the original code base, request
  updates to the code, or suggest that the code be maintained as an external patch or plug-in.</p>
<p>Contributions are always encouraged, and generally fall into one of two groups, as determined by project Committers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug fixes and minor patches are accepted with little overhead.</li>
  <li>Major contributions require the contributor to sign a form stating that the submitter is free to commit the code (individually or on behalf of an employer), and that the code
    complies with the current toolkit license terms.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Due diligence for submission of bug fixes and patches from non-committers</h2>
  <p>Any organization or individual may submit bug fixes using a GitHub "pull request", generally tied to a specific report in the project's issue tracker.</p>
  <p>Before committing code from a bug fix or patch provided by a third party who has not signed a current contribution form for the project, Committers should ask the following
    questions and follow up as appropriate in order to ensure that the code can be contributed to the project: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is your name and who is your employer?</li>
    <li>Did you write the code that you wish to contribute to the DITA Open Toolkit project? (If the contributor says no, the code should not become a “Contribution” to the project.
      The contributor may be asked to identify the complete details of the code’s source and of any licenses or restrictions applicable to the code, but the work should be
      conspicuously marked as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [name of contributor]”.)</li>
    <li>Do you have the right to grant the copyright and patent licenses for the contribution that are set forth in the Apache License version 2.0?</li>
    <li>Does your employer have any rights to code that you have written, for example, through your contract for employment? If so, has your employer given you permission to contribute
      the code on its behalf or waived its rights in the code?</li>
    <li>Are you aware of any third-party licenses or other restrictions (such as related patents or trademarks) that could apply to your contribution? If so, what are they?</li>
  </ul>
