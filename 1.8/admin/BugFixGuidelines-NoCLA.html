<h1 class="title topictitle1">Due diligence for submission of bug fixes and patches from
non-committers</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Any organization or individual may submit bug fixes using
a github "pull request", generally tied to a specific report in the
project's issue tracker.</p>

<p class="p">Before committing code from a bug fix or patch provided by a third
party who has not signed a current contribution form for the project,
Committers should ask the following questions and follow up as appropriate
in order to ensure that the code can be contributed to the project: </p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">What is your name and who is your employer?</li>

<li class="li">Did you write the code that you wish to contribute to the DITA
Open          Toolkit project? (If the contributor says no, the code
should not become a “Contribution” to the project. The contributor
may be asked to identify the complete details of the code’s source
and of any licenses or restrictions applicable to the code, but the
work should be conspicuously marked as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party:
[name of contributor]”.)</li>

<li class="li">Do you have the right to grant the copyright and patent licenses
for the contribution that are set forth in the CPL version 1.0 license
and Apache License version 2.0?</li>

<li class="li">Does your employer have any rights to code that you have written,
for example, through your contract for employment? If so, has your
employer given you permission to contribute the code on its behalf
or waived its rights in the code?</li>

<li class="li">Are you aware of any third-party licenses or other restrictions
(such as related patents or trademarks) that could apply to your contribution?
If so, what are they?</li>

</ul>
