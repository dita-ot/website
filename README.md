# DITA Open Toolkit website [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0102588e-07a5-423b-8b26-aac92e14c168/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dita-ot/deploys)

This repository contains the source files for the **DITA Open Toolkit** project website at [dita-ot.org][1].

For details and background information on how we build and maintain the site, visit [dita-ot.org/colophon][2].

If you'd like to set up a local staging environment and build a copy of the site, follow the instructions below.

## Environment setup

1.  Clone the DITA-OT and project website repositories:

        git clone https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot.git
        git clone https://github.com/dita-ot/website.git

    **NOTE:** The examples below assume the the DITA-OT and project website repositories have been cloned to a common parent directory, such as your home folder. If you clone the repositories to a different location, substitute that path for the tilde symbol `~` in the samples below.

2.  Move to the DITA-OT directory:

        cd dita-ot

3.  Fetch the submodules:

        git submodule update --init --recursive

4.  In the root directory, run the Gradle wrapper to compile the Java code and install plugins:

        ./gradlew

5.  Install the HTML plug-in for the DITA-OT project website: `org.dita-ot.html`

        src/main/bin/dita --install https://github.com/dita-ot/org.dita-ot.html/archive/master.zip

## Install prerequisite software

1.  Check if [Ruby][3] is installed:

        ruby -v

    Ruby is installed on macOS and most Linux distributions by default. If the command above does not respond with information on the installed Ruby version, see [Installing Ruby][4] for instructions.

2.  Install [Jekyll][5]:

        gem install jekyll

3.  Install [Bundler][6]:

        gem install bundler

4.  Switch to your clone of the project website repository:

        cd ~/dita-ot-website

5.  Install all of the required gems from the project’s `Gemfile`:

        bundle install

6.  Run Jekyll.

        bundle exec jekyll serve

    This runs the production version of the site locally, so you can view your local clone of the project website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/][7].

    At this stage, what you see there should be identical to the production version of the project website at [www.dita-ot.org][1].

    **Note:** For more details, see [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll][8].

## Building site output

1.  Switch to the `docsrc` submodule of the local `dita-ot` clone:

        cd ~/dita-ot/src/main/docsrc

2.  Check out the `develop` branch of the `docs` repository to update the `docsrc` submodule pointer to the latest development state _(or to another branch if you need to generate output for that)_:

        git checkout develop

3.  Run the `site` build task with the Gradle wrapper to generate the output for the project website:

        ./gradlew site

The output will be generated by default in `src/main/docsrc/build/site`.

_(This appears as unstyled HTML when viewed in place.)_

To redirect the output to the `dev` development folder that Jekyll serves, pass the `outputDir` parameter to the build script as follows:

    ./gradlew site -PoutputDir=~/dita-ot-website/dev

After the build completes, you should find the results in the **Docs \> Development** section of the local staging environment [http://127.0.0.1:4000/dev/][9].

To automatically regenerate the site output whenever documentation source files change, add the `--continuous` build option:

    ./gradlew site -PoutputDir=~/dita-ot-website/dev --continuous

## Updating JavaScript

If you need to change any of the JavaScript files in the site repository, you'll need to [download & install Node.js][10] and run the `npm` package manager for JavaScript to perform a clean install of the project dependencies:

    npm ci

This will install various Node modules including [Parcel][11], the web application bundler.

To make changes to the JavaScript code, add or edit source files in the `_js` folder. You can then run the `install` script to re-bundle the modified JavaScript code to the `js` folder with Parcel:

    npm run install

## Happy staging!

You can now use the local staging environment to test your changes before committing your work.
