<p class="lead">You can help us make the toolkit better by finding and reporting bugs, participating in community support, and improving the code and documentation.</p>

## Reporting bugs

We use GitHub as our [issue tracker][1]. There you can submit bug reports and make feature suggestions. If you find a bug and you don’t know how to fix it, [create an issue][2] to request changes.

Before you do that, [review the open issues][1] to make sure it hasn't already been reported. We have separate issue trackers for the [documentation][3] and [website code][4].

## Community support

You can help give back to the community by answering DITA-OT–related questions on the [DITA-OT Users Google Group][5], the [Yahoo! dita-users group][6] or [StackOverflow][7].

## Development discussions

We use [Slack][8] to discuss DITA-OT development and design issues, plan events and keep tabs on revisions in our GitHub repositories. Developers and vendors using the toolkit are encouraged to join the [DITA-OT Slack team][9] to discuss upcoming changes.

To request an invitation and join the conversation, visit [slack.dita-ot.org][10].

## Coding

_Have XSLT or Java coding skills?_

You can contribute fixes to [bugs][11] or new features by sending [pull requests][12] via GitHub.

## Documentation

_Have writing or editing skills?_

If you find something wrong or missing in the [documentation][13], you can [open an issue on GitHub][14] to describe the problem or suggest new topics we might want to include in future versions of the DITA-OT docs.

If you'd like to fix a typo or propose changes to an existing topic, you can use the **Edit this page** link in the page footers of the [development version of the documentation][13] to open the source file in a web editor and save your changes to a GitHub [pull request][12].
