The map-first preprocessing approach provides a modern       alternative to the default <code class="ph codeph">preprocess</code> operation.</span></li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.5.html">Migrating to release 2.5</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.5, several frequently-overridden legacy style settings were removed from the default PDF     plug-in. A separate plug-in can be used to restore the original settings.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.4.html">Migrating to release 2.4</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.4, the <span class="keyword option">HTML5</span> transformation was refactored as an independent plug-in that no     longer depends on the <span class="keyword option">XHTML</span> plug-in. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.3.html">Migrating to release 2.3</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.3, <span class="keyword option">HTML5</span> table processing has been refactored to use HTML5 best practices and     improved CSS properties. In PDF output, table heads and key columns no longer include shading, and unused     localization variables have been deprecated. The template for generated error messages has been updated to use a     single <code class="ph codeph">id</code> variable that contains the entire message ID.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.2.html">Migrating to release 2.2</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.2, the <span class="keyword option">HTML5</span> transformation was refactored as its own plug-in and separate     plug-ins were created for each of the rendering engine-specific PDF transformations.    </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.1.html">Migrating to release 2.1</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.1, the <code class="ph codeph">insertVariable</code> template was deprecated for PDF transformations and     should be replaced with the <code class="ph codeph">getVariable</code> template. Various <code class="ph codeph">dita.<strong class="ph b">out.</strong>map.*</code>     targets have been deprecated in favor of updated <code class="ph codeph">dita.map.*</code> equivalents.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-2.0.html">Migrating to release 2.0</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 2.0, XSLT templates were converted to XSLT 2.0, variable typing was implemented, and some older     templates were refactored or removed. In addition, the <span class="keyword cmdname">dita</span> command simplifies distribution of     plugins by allowing installation from a URL.    </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-1.8.html">Migrating to release 1.8</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 1.8, certain stylesheets were moved to plug-in specific folders and various deprecated Ant     properties, XSLT stylesheets, parameters and modes were removed from the XHTML, PDF and ODT     transformations.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-1.7.html">Migrating to release 1.7</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 1.7, a new preprocessing step implements flagging for HTML-based output formats. PDF processing     was corrected with regard to <code class="ph codeph">shortdesc</code> handling, and a new XSLT template mode was introduced for     HTML TOC processing. Several stylesheets were moved to plug-in specific folders and deprecated properties and XSLT     variables were removed. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-1.6.html">Migrating to release 1.6</a></strong><br>In DITA-OT 1.6, various <span class="ph filepath">demo</span> plug-ins were removed along with many deprecated     properties, targets, templates and modes. The PDF2 transformation no longer supports the beta version of DITA from     IBM, the "bkinfo" demo plug-in, or <span class="ph filepath">layout-masters.xml</span> configuration.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/migrating-to-1.5.4.html">Migrating to release 1.5.4</a></strong><br>DITA-OT 1.5.4 adds new extension points to configure behavior based on file extensions, declare print     transformation types and add mappings to the PDF configuration catalog file. PDF output supports mirrored page     layout and uses new font family definitions. Support for several new languages was added for PDF and XHTML     output.</li></ul></nav></main>
